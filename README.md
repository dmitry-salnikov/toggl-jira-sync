# toggl-jira-sync

## Tool for syncing from Toggl to Jira based on the following asert:
*The "description" field on Toggl are equal to "key" of the ticket in Jira.*
*There's one transition which contains "reopen" as part of the name*
*There's one transition which contains "close" as part of the name*

###In the future, we should:
1. Add support and "link" between Toggl "workspace" and Jira "project"
2. Encrypt local data saved
3. Put some UI :)
